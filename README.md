# TIC-TAC-TOE_
A Python program for a classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Two players take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid with either X or O. The first player to get three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
